					<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
					<div id="whoFuzzy">
						<p>Fuzzy Binaires is seeking collaboration and community through our shared practices of open coding,
							tinkering and making art. Our aim is to co-create a space in which people feel comfortable to work
							along and through differences, situatedness and barriers. We foster self-motivated and
							self-organized
							learning and think people learn best through following their curiosities and desires.

					<div class="col">
						<h3>MISSION STATEMENT</h3>

						<div id="whoFuzzy">
							<p>
								With the rise of technology-based frameworks for creative inquiry, the world has seen a very
								diverse, eclectic, and extremely interdisciplinary approach towards the creation of artwork.
								Ideas
								and practices that date back to the 1970s are now widespread among a community of art-making
								individuals who are successfully merging and creating dialogues between their own practice and
								the
								power and language of computational devices.
							</p>
							<p>
								For some artist, the idea of needing to learn the technicalities that computers entail might be
								daunting at first. It means learning a new language. It means understanding the very complex
								realm
								of the digital. It means creating a bridge to interface between the traditional and the future.
								And even for the experienced electronic artist, the umbrella of the computerized medium is so
								intricate and labyrinthian, that it might seem intimidating to stay up-to-date with the latest
								art-making algorithms.
							</p>
							<p>
								The mission of Fuzzy Binaries is to gently bridge the gap between art and computation. It is to
								create the connections necessary to explore how practices like computer programming, video-game
								design or decentralized collaborative sharing can become suitable means of artistic creation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Understanding how an algorithm can become a brush stroke, how sensors can completely transform a
								space, or how procedurally-generated narratives can drive a game's experience, is all part of
								the
								purpose of becoming a Fuzzy Binary: it is <strong>exploring the in-betweens and the end-points
									of the
									interface between humans and computers</strong>. Along the way, we will also learn about the
								ethical
								implications that technology carries with it, and how it is transforming society form an arts
								perspective.
							</p>
							<p>
								Becoming a Fuzzy Binary is also about building a community of like-minded artists and
								technologist
								who enjoy art and code, promoting an open and positive environment, where ideas are encouraged
								and
								where learning is done by fostering curiosity and the enjoyment of the process. This means
								creating
								accessible opportunities and prioritizing the application of groups of people often marginalized
								in
								the tech industry.

						<h3>GENERAL OBJECTIVES</h3>

						<div id="whoFuzzy">
							<p>
								These are the high-level objectives that span across all programs, and are put into practice
								in all proposed workshops and events:
							</p>

							<br>

							<p>
							<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
								<li class="list-group-item">Teach fundamental skills in software programming, prototyping,
									design, critical thinking.</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">Support the development of an end-of-program production or
									exhibition. This includes
									brainstorming sessions, sketching, technical research, storytelling, and design.</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">Offer and structure discussions and exchange in regard to the
									theme.
									We will organize reading sessions of selected theoretical texts.</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">Foster group dynamics, e. g. improvisations, stretching, cooking
									sessions etc.</li>
